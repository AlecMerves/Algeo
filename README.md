Welcome to Algeo!

This is a personal project I've started alongside a course I'm taking currently about computational geometry. 
My goal for this project is to create an windows application that can plot points, draw polygons, and perform various 
algorithms upon them. As well, I hope to have the app include animations/visualizations of the algorithms as they run,
and provide output in terms of backend information about the algorithm. I've started this project with two goals in mind: 
to learn the Win32 API and better my understanding of class material. Hopefully this this project will culminate in a 
decently working application that may help others interested in these topics.
